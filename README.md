  <li>Then, copy and paste the <a href="https://github.com/DudeUnoob/Aceable-Autoanswer-Script/blob/main/index.js">index.js</a> script in this repository and replace it with the existing code that
  tampermonkey placed when you created that "new script" in the previous step
</li>

  <li>Ctrl + S or "Save" the script (File > Save)</li>
  <li>Finally, go back to aceable and refresh the page to load the script</li>
  <ul>
    <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">COMMON ISSUES WITH THIS STEP</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>To get pass this, do the command Ctrl + Shift + I, or F12, or right click and press inspect and then refresh the page (the script should work) </li>
    </ul>

  </ul>
</ol>
